### Project done as part of the FrontEnd Mentor Challanges

## Focus of this project:

- prepare the page with mobile-first approach
- entry level JS

### Notes:

- had to spend some time with managing the custom input
- should have the logic planned out before starting to code it (it would save time and make the code more readible)
